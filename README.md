# Malaria Cell Segmentation Using Machine-Learning & Deep-Learning

# Data
Data came from three different labsâ€™ ex vivo samples of P. vivax infected patients in Manaus, Brazil, and Thailand. The Manaus and Thailand data were used for training and validation while the Brazil data were left out as our test set. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa reagent, which attaches to DNA and allow experts to inspect infected cells and determine their stage.

It can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/malaria-bounding-boxes)


# Usage
Clone the repository and run the following commands from the terminal.

Then download the dataset from given link and copy and paste the data into input folder. All the images from dataset should be put into "input/training_images" folder.
